# Spelling Bee Web - Multiplayer Word Game

## Overview
A real-time multiplayer word game (2-8 players) inspired by the New York Times Spelling Bee. Players compete to find as many words as possible from a set of 7 letters in timed rounds. Converted from mobile to web platform with enhanced multiplayer support.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Game Structure
- **3 rounds total** - winner has highest total score across all rounds
- **90 seconds per round**
- **7 letters per round** (6 outer + 1 center, using NYT Spelling Bee letter sets)
- **Center letter must be included in every valid word**
- **4+ letter words only** - matches Spelling Bee dataset requirements
- **Letters can be reused** - no restrictions on letter repetition within words
- **2-8 players** - scalable multiplayer design

### Scoring System
**Exponential scoring based on word length:**
- 4 letters = 16 points (4Â²)
- 5 letters = 25 points (5Â²)
- 6 letters = 36 points (6Â²)
- 7+ letters = lengthÂ² points

**Pangram Bonus:**
- **+25 bonus points** for any word using all 7 letters
- 7-letter pangram total = 74 points (49 base + 25 bonus)

### Round Flow
1. All players receive the same 7 letters
2. 90-second timer starts
3. Players find words independently
4. Timer ends, results revealed in leaderboard format
5. Show all players' word lists with unique word highlighting
6. Manual "Ready for next round" confirmation required
7. Repeat for rounds 2 and 3
8. Declare winner based on total score

## Technical Architecture

### Platform
- **Frontend:** React + Vite web application
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + Socket.io server
- **Deployment:** Docker containerized
- **Real-time:** WebSocket connections for game state sync

### Input Methods
- **Mouse/Touch:** Click hexagon letters to build words
- **Keyboard:** Type letters directly, use Backspace to delete, Enter to submit
- **Hybrid:** Both input methods work simultaneously

### Data Source
**NYT Spelling Bee puzzle data:** 2,554+ historical puzzles (2018-2025)
- Each day stored as individual JSON files with complete puzzle data
- **Center letter requirement maintained** (exactly like official Spelling Bee)
- Random puzzle selection for each game from available dataset
- All valid words and pangrams are pre-validated

### Client Architecture

**Modern React patterns with hooks and component extraction:**

#### **Custom Hooks**

- **Submission animations** - Success/error messages with type-specific styling
- **Pangram celebrations** - Special animations for bonus words
- **Leaderboard rankings** - Medal system (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰) with current player highlighting
- **Unique word highlighting** - Visual distinction for words only you found

## Multiplayer Features

### Scalable Design

- **Dynamic layouts** - Word comparison adapts to player count
- **Ready status tracking** - Shows which players are ready for next round
- **Real-time notifications** - Toast messages when players join/ready up

### Game Flow
1. **Room Creation** - Host creates room, gets shareable code
2. **Player Joining** - Others join using room code
3. **Lobby Waiting** - All players must ready up to start
4. **Synchronized Rounds** - All players get same puzzles simultaneously
5. **Results Sharing** - Compare words and see who found unique terms
6. **Game Restart** - Play again with same group or return to lobby
